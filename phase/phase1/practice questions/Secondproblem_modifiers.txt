Types of access modifiers in java


There are four access modifiers keywords in Java and they are:

Modifier	Description
Default	declarations are visible only within the package (package private)
Private	declarations are visible within the class only
Protected	declarations are visible within the package or all subclasses
Public	declarations are visible everywhere



examples 


1)Default Access Modifier
package defaultPackage;
class Logger {
    void message(){
        System.out.println("This is a message");
    }
}



Description-Here, the Logger class has the default access modifier. And the class is visible to all the classes that belong to the defaultPackage package. However, if we try to use the Logger class in another class outside of defaultPackage, we will get a compilation error.




2)Private Access Modifier


class Data {
    // private variable
    private String name;
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] main){

        // create an object of Data
        Data d = new Data();

        // access private variable and field from another class
        d.name = "Programiz";
    }
}



Description-The error is generated because we are trying to access the private variable and the private method of the Data class from the Main class.


3)Protected Access Modifier

class Animal {
    // protected method
    protected void display() {
        System.out.println("I am an animal");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // create an object of Dog class
        Dog dog = new Dog();
         // access protected method
        dog.display();
    }
}


Description - We then created an object dog of the Dog class. Using the object we tried to access the protected method of the parent class.

Since protected methods can be accessed from the child classes, we are able to access the method of Animal class from the Dog class.


4)Public Access Modifier-
// Animal.java file
// public class
public class Animal {
    // public variable
    public int legCount;

    // public method
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("I am an animal.");
        System.out.println("I have " + legCount + " legs.");
    }
}

// Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        // accessing the public class
        Animal animal = new Animal();

        // accessing the public variable
        animal.legCount = 4;
        // accessing the public method
        animal.display();
    }
}

Description -The public class Animal is accessed from the Main class.
The public variable legCount is accessed from the Main class.
The public method display() is accessed from the Main class.


output of all above 4 programmes-

2)Main.java:18: error: name has private access in Data
        d.name = "Programiz";

output=The name is Programiz using getter and setter method
3)I am an animal


4)I am an animal
  I have four leg.
